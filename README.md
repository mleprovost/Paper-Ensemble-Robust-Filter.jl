# RobustFilter.jl

*A Julia package for robust ensemble filtering*



This repository is a companion to the work [^1]: [Le Provost, Baptista, Eldredge, and Marzouk (2023) "An adaptive ensemble filter for heavy-tailed distributions: tuning-free inflation and localization," under preparation.]



In this paper, we introduce a 


This repository contains the source code and Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the numerical experiments and Figures in Le Provost et al. [^1]


## Installation
